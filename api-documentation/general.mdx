## Environments

Test using the sandbox environment, which doesnâ€™t touch real money. Contact the Palommma team when you are ready for production release.

Production

```jsx
https://prod.api.palomma.com/v0
```

Sandbox

```jsx
https://sandbox.api.palomma.com/v0
```

<Note>The sandbox environment will be erased periodically.</Note>

## Authentication

You should have received an API key from the onboarding process. Every request to the Palomma API should include an Authentication header.

```jsx
Authentication: `Bearer ${apiKey}`;
```

## Limits

The default maximum limit per transaction for payins is `$2.000.000 COP`. For payouts it is `$5.000.000 COP`.

<Tip>
  Contact us if you need higher limits. We are happy to accomodate your business
  needs.

## Settlement Times

Once a payin operation is approved, the funds will become available to you the next business day.
